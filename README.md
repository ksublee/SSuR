Lecture materials for "Stochastic Simulation" course.

* .md : These are github markdown documents. Unfortunately, currently github markdown does not support LaTex, thus math equations are not rendered perfectly.

* .Rmd : R markdown documents written in Rstudio. Students can download .Rmd files and modify or knit to html and save as pdf files or print them.

* .html : After downloading files, you can open .html files in your web browser and print the lecture notes.


These materials are based on the follwing great books:

[Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Scientific-Programming-Simulation-Chapman/dp/1420068725)
[Advanced R](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Chapman-Hall-Hadley-Wickham/dp/1466586966)
[R in a Nutshell](https://www.amazon.com/R-Nutshell-Desktop-Quick-Reference/dp/144931208X)
[Software for Data Analysis : Programming with R](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Data-Analysis-Programming-Statistics/dp/0387759352)
