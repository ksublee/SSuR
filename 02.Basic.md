R Basic Programming
================

### Branching with if

``` r
if ( logical_expression ) {  
  expression_1
}  
```

``` r
if (logical_expression) {   
  expression_1
} else {
  expression_2
}  
```

If `logical_expression` is `TRUE` then the first group of expression is
executed and the second group of expression is not executed.

Conversely if `logical_expression` is `FALSE` then only the second group
expression is executed.

If you type:

``` r
if (logical_expression) {
  expression_1
}
else {  
  expression_2  
}  
```

then you get an error.

This is because R believes the if statement is finished before it sees
the else part.  
That is, R treats the else as the start of a new command, but there is
no command that starts with an else.

The followings are equivalent.

``` r
if (logical_expression_1){    
  expression_1    
} else {   
    if (logical_expression_2){   
      expression_2  
    } else {   
      expression_3  
    }      
}
```

``` r
if (logical_expression_1){   
  expression_1   
} else if (logical_expression_2){   
  expression_2   
} else {   
  expression_3   
}
```

#### Example : root of quadratic

``` r
rm(list=ls())

a0 <- 1; a1 <- 6; a2 <- 7
discrim <- a1^2 - 4*a2*a0

if (discrim > 0) {
  roots <- c( (-a1 + sqrt(a1^2 - 4*a2*a0))/(2*a2), (-a1 - sqrt(a1^2 - 4*a2*a0))/(2*a2) )
} else if (discrim == 0) {
  roots <- -a1/(2*a2)
} else {
  roots <- c() 
}

show(roots)
```

### Looping with for

``` r
for (x in vector) {  
  expression_1   
  ...   
}
```

where `x` is a simple variable.

#### Example : summing a vector

We have a built-in function sum() but for an illustrative purpose:

``` r
(x_list <- seq(1, 9, by = 2))
```

    ## [1] 1 3 5 7 9

``` r
sum_x <- 0
for (x in x_list) {
  sum_x <- sum_x + x
  cat("The current loop element is", x, "\n")
  cat("The cumulative total is", sum_x, "\n")
}
```

    ## The current loop element is 1 
    ## The cumulative total is 1 
    ## The current loop element is 3 
    ## The cumulative total is 4 
    ## The current loop element is 5 
    ## The cumulative total is 9 
    ## The current loop element is 7 
    ## The cumulative total is 16 
    ## The current loop element is 9 
    ## The cumulative total is 25

-   `cat()` : for concatenate
-   `\n` : new line

#### Example : n factorial

``` r
n <- 6
n_factorial <- 1
for (i in 1:n) {
  n_factorial <- n_factorial * i
}
show(n_factorial)
```

#### Example : pension

``` r
r <- 0.11             # Annual interest rate
term <- 10            # Forecast duration (in years)
period <- 1/12        # Time between payments (in years)
payments <- 100       # Amount deposited each period
# Calculations

n <- floor(term/period)  # Number of payments
pension <- 0
for (i in 1:n) {
  pension[i+1] <- pension[i]*(1 + r*period) + payments
}
time <- (0:n)*period

# Output
plot(time, pension)
```

#### Example : redimensioning

Program 1 and 2 produce the same result but 1 is faster.

``` r
#Program1
n <- 100000
x <- rep(0, n)
for (i in 1:n) x[i] <- i
```

``` r
#Program2
n <- 100000
x <- 1
for (i in 2:n) x[i] <- i
```

Program1 of preallocation is faster than Program2 of redimensioning.

### Looping with while

``` r
while (logical_expression) {   
  expression_1   
  ...   
}
```

-   `logical_expression` is evaluated first.

-   If it is `TRUE`, then the expression in `{ }` is executed.

    -   back to the start of the command.

-   If `logical_expression` is `FALSE`, the loop stop.

-   We can always rewrite a for loop as a while loop.

#### Example : Fibonacci numbers

``` r
rm(list=ls())
F <- c(1, 1)
n <- 2
while (F[n] <= 100) {
  n <- n +1
  F[n] <- F[n-1] + F[n-2]
}
cat("The first Fibonacci number > 100 is F(", n, ") =", F[n], "\n")
```

    ## The first Fibonacci number > 100 is F( 12 ) = 144

### Example : compound interest rate

``` r
rm(list=ls())
r <- 0.11                # Annual rate
period <- 1/12           # Time between repayments (in years)
debt_initial <- 1000     # Amount borrowed
repayments <- 12         # Amount repaid each period

# Calculations
time <- 0
debt <- debt_initial
while (debt > 0) {
  time <- time + period
  debt <- debt*(1 + r*period) - repayments
}

# Output
cat('Loan will be repaid in', time, 'years\n')
```

    ## Loan will be repaid in 13.25 years

### Vector-based programming

Using vector operations is more efficient computationally.  
Sum of the first n squares using loop:

``` r
n <- 100; S <- 0
for (i in 1:n)  S <- S + i^2
print(S)
```

Alternatively, using vector operations:

``` r
sum((1:n)^2)
```

#### `ifelse`

The `ifelse` function performs elementwise conditional evaluation upon a
vector.  
`ifelse` returns a value with the same shape as `test` which is filled
with elements selected from either yes or no depending on whether the
element of test is `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

-   `ifelse(test, A, B)`
    -   `test` : logical expression
    -   returns a vector consist of
        -   `A` : when element of test are `TRUE`
        -   `B` : when element of test are `FALSE`

``` r
x <- c(-2, -1, 1, 2)
ifelse( x>0, "Positive", "Negative")
```

    ## [1] "Negative" "Negative" "Positive" "Positive"

#### `pmin` and `pmax`

-   vectorised versions of the minimum and maximum  
-   `pmax` and `pmin` take one or more vectors as arguments, recycle
    them to common length and return a single vector giving the parallel
    maxima (or minima) of the argument vectors.

``` r
pmin( c(1, 2, 3), c(3, 2, 1), c(2, 2, 2))
```

### Program flow

``` r
x <- 3
for (i in 1:3) {
  show(x)
  if (x %% 2 == 0) {
    x <- x/2
  } else {
    x <- 3*x + 1
  }
}
```

    ## [1] 3
    ## [1] 10
    ## [1] 5

``` r
show(x)
```

    ## [1] 16

### Basic debugging : correcting errors

-   To find an error or bug, you need to see how your variables change.

    -   include statements like `cat("var=", var, "\n")`

-   dry run : using simple starting conditions for which you know what
    the answer should be.

    -   use short and simple versions of the final program

-   Use graph and summary statistics.

-   Careful use of indentation.

#### Example

``` r
x <- 3
for (i in 1:3) {
  show(x)
  cat("i = ", i, "\n")
  if (x %% 2 == 0) {
    x <- x/2
  } else {
    x <- 3*x + 1
  }
}
```

    ## [1] 3
    ## i =  1 
    ## [1] 10
    ## i =  2 
    ## [1] 5
    ## i =  3

``` r
show(x)
```

    ## [1] 16

### Good programming habits

-   Good programming is clear rather than clever.
    -   in practice, much more time is spent correcting and modifying
        codes than is ever spent writing them.
-   Write comments.
-   Variable name should be descriptive.
    -   Avoid using reserved names of functions
        -   for example, `t`, `c` and `q` are all function names in R
        -   check with `exists()` function
-   Use blank line to separate sections.
